# üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT FIX - Production Build Required

## Problem Identified
The console errors show the web part is trying to load JavaScript files from `localhost:4321` instead of SharePoint. This means the current `.sppkg` package was built in **debug mode**.

### Console Errors Analysis:
```
‚ùå https://localhost:4321/dist/adaptive-card-viewer-web-part.js - 404 Not Found
‚ùå dashboard-web-part_aaa131f1230b4ce01e95.js - 404 Not Found  
‚ùå DashboardWebPartStrings_en-us_2f959d82f4358adf7d31831ca2efc216.js - 404 Not Found
```

## üîß SOLUTION: Create Production Build

### Step 1: Clean Previous Build
```powershell
cd "c:\code\AdaptiveCards\spfx-adaptivecard-solution"
gulp clean
```

### Step 2: Create Production Build
```powershell
gulp bundle --ship
```

### Step 3: Create Production Package
```powershell
gulp package-solution --ship
```

### Step 4: Deploy Production Package
- Upload `sharepoint/solution/spfx-adaptivecard-solution.sppkg` to App Catalog
- The `--ship` flag ensures assets are included in the package, not served from localhost

## üéØ Key Differences: Debug vs Production

### Debug Build (Current - BROKEN):
- Assets served from `localhost:4321` 
- Requires local development server running
- Does NOT work in production SharePoint

### Production Build (Required - WORKING):
- Assets embedded in `.sppkg` package
- No external dependencies
- Works in production SharePoint

## üöÄ Quick Fix Command
Run this single command to create a proper production package:

```powershell
cd "c:\code\AdaptiveCards\spfx-adaptivecard-solution" && gulp clean && gulp bundle --ship && gulp package-solution --ship
```

After running this, upload the new `.sppkg` file from `sharepoint/solution/` to your SharePoint App Catalog.

## ‚úÖ Verification
After deployment, the console should show:
- No localhost:4321 references
- No 404 errors for JavaScript files
- Web parts load properly in SharePoint pages

This will fix the "message creator in sharepoint not working" issue!
