   Manager Display Name: Therese Almesjo
   Is Active: Yes
   Department: Administration
   Manager Level: Senior Manager
   ```

- **Manager Dashboard**: For manager-only administrative functions

#### **Option B: Teams Integration**
Install as Teams app for channel integration

### **Step 5: Test Deployment**

#### **Manager Access Testing**
1. **Test with Manager Account** (listed in Managers list):

3. **List Permissions**: Verify users can read but not edit Managers list

## 🔐 **Security Configuration**

### **Managers List Permissions**
**Critical**: Set proper permissions on the Managers list:

1. **Break Inheritance**:
